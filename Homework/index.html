					<b>Comp  1850 - Web Development and Design 01</b>, from the BCIT websites' course description
					<i>"Learn the fundamental principles and techniques to design and develop effective Web sites."</i>
					I took up comp 1850 basically because it was a prerequisite of the program I'm looking forward 
					to take this incoming semester although I am quite familiar with all of the topics to be discussed 
					on this particular class I wanted to refresh my memory and learn more that I haven't learned from my past experience.

				<div><!--Second Paragraph-->
					<p style="text-indent:50px;"> 
						I recently graduated my Bachelor's Degree of Information Technology from my home country. We had learned everything about technology 
						about all the languages used by all of the developers.I am confident that I am familiar with all of technology topics but not to its core and 
						that I had have experience of doing projects before involving the use of html 5, css3, java programming and the like.
						Although I was not really required to take this course but in order to complete my application and since I'm new to this land and new to all of 
						these advance technologies that this country has I want to take this course and take it as an advantage that I will meet people that have the same 
						interest that I have. I want this course to be my stepping stone as I reach for my dream.
					</p>

				<div><!--Third Paragraph-->
					<p style="text-indent:50px;">
						We once travel to Kamloops just after I arrive here at Canada. We dine in on this exquisite Chinese restaurant where they gave out fortune cookies, 
						and when I did cracked my fortune cookie this is what it says:
						<br><font color="0000CD	"><b><center><i> "Ride your ambition to the skies."</i></center></b></font>
						<br>
						I still have the paper in my drawer and I keep looking at it as a sign so I just trusted my fortune cookie, I will ride my ambition to the skies and <b>Comp 1850</b> will be my first vessel to reach the sky. 
						<b>The sky is the limit!<b>
